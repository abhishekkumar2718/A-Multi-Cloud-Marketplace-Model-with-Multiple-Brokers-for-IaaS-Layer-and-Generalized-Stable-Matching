# A Multi Cloud Marketplace Model with Multiple Brokers for IaaS Layer and Generalized Stable Matching

A visualisation of the paper by the same name. Made for CS466 Cloud Computing Course Project.

> The application is also accessible as a 
> [website](https://abhishekkumar2718.github.io/A-Multi-Cloud-Marketplace-Model-with-Multiple-Brokers-for-IaaS-Layer-and-Generalized-Stable-Matching/)
> and the source code is available on my [Github
> repository](https://github.com/abhishekkumar2718/A-Multi-Cloud-Marketplace-Model-with-Multiple-Brokers-for-IaaS-Layer-and-Generalized-Stable-Matching/).

## Installation

In case you wish to use the application locally, you will need an
application to serve the HTML files locally. I personally prefer using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but you can use applications like
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/),
[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) or even full-blown production web
servers like Apache and Nginx.

I have provided instructions for Jekyll installation below:

1. Change to project root:

```bash
cd A-Multi-Cloud-Marketplace-Model-with-Multiple-Brokers-for-IaaS-Layer-and-Generalized-Stable-Matching/

```
2. Install Jekyll - any version is fine as we are simply serving the
   files. This does require _some_ installation of Ruby to proceed.

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

3. Serve files:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

4. If everything went well, you should be able to access the website on [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:4000/A-Multi-Cloud-Marketplace-Model-with-Multiple-Brokers-for-IaaS-Layer-and-Generalized-Stable-Matching/).
